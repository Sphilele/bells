                      <p className="tribute--paragraph">Love is a complex and multifaceted emotion that encompasses far more than just romance and passion. While these elements are undoubtedly important components of love, true love is about much more than just physical attraction. It is about sharing a deep and meaningful connection with another person, one that is built on a foundation of trust, respect, and understanding. It is about being there for each other through thick and thin, supporting each other dreams and aspirations, and working together to overcome challenges and obstacles. Ultimately, love is about creating a life together that is filled with happiness, joy, and fulfillment, and that is built on a foundation of mutual respect, admiration, and unconditional love.</p>
                      <p className="tribute--paragraph">We know that we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are committed to building a life together that is filled with happiness, joy, and fulfillment. We are excited to take on new challenges, to grow and learn together, and to create a life that is truly our own.</p>
